h2. Marking Products and Components as Taxable

Unless otherwise specified, all products and components are NOT eligible for taxes. Once a tax is defined, you will need to update your existing products and components so that they can be taxed. To do this, edit the product or component and check the 'This product is subject to taxes' checkbox.

You will also want to ensure that the "Require Shipping Address at signup?" checkbox is also checked for each product.

Note that Avalara needs a full address on file in order to calculate taxes.

h2. Coupons and Taxes

When applied in conjunction, taxes are applied to the total cost of the subscription AFTER the coupon adjustment has been accounted for.
