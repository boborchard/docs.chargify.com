You can customize the look and feel of your Public Pages (formerly known as Hosted Pages) to match your site by uploading a logo, providing custom CSS and JavaScript, and specifying URLs that link back to your site. There are two ways of doing this: you can either edit the Default Settings that apply to all Public Pages at once or, if you want additional control, Public Signup Pages allow you to edit their "individual settings":/public-signup-page-settings by overriding the Default Settings.

__This section describes how to customize the look, feel, and behavior of your Public Pages.  If you need information on how to use the Public Pages to sell Subscriptions, please see the "Public Pages Intro":/public-pages-intro documentation.__

h3. Choosing Default Setings for all Public Pages

To customize the Default Settings, click the "Settings" tab and then select the "Public Page Default Settings" in the menu on the left.

h4. Page Title

The title will be displayed at the top of the page and in the title of the browser window. The {{product_name}} and {{product_family}} keywords will be replaced with the actual product name and product family name of the product. If left blank, the title will be set as "Product Family Name: Product Name".

h4. Upload your logo

To upload a logo, use the file upload button to select your image. Supported file types are .gif, .jpeg, and .png. Images will automatically be resized to a maximum width of 800px and a maximum height of 100px.

h4. Add Custom CSS and JavaScript

The "Public Page Default Settings" tab also provides input fields to collect custom CSS and JavaScript for your site. Content in the CSS field will be included at the top of the page in a @stylesheet@ tag. Custom JavaScript will be included at the bottom of the page and wrapped in a @script@ tag.

h4. Custom Links

The 'Public Page Default Settings' tab also provides input fields to collect custom urls. If a 'Home link URL' is provided, the title of the page or the Logo will link to that URL. 'Terms and conditions URL' and 'Privacy policy URL' links will appear in the footer if provided. Additionally, if a Terms link is provided a checkbox will appear to require the user to agree to the terms.

Check the checkbox next to each card logo for that logo to display on the Public Signup Page. Note that unchecking one of the the cards will not prevent users from entering a card of that type.
