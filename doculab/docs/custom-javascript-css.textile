For information on how to add Custom JavasScript and CSS to your Public Pages, please see "Public Page Default Settings":/public-page-default-settings and "Public Signup Page Settings":/public-signup-page-settings.

These snippets of code are intended as examples to show how to select and modify different elements on the Public Pages. Chargify Support can provide assistance with simple changes such as hiding a field or restricting the country location for new signups.  Depending on your level of expertise, it may be necessary to engage a Web Developer to accomplish more complex requirements.

Each snippet has been tested in isolation.  If snippets are combined with each other, or with existing Custom JavaScript and CSS on your Public Pages, unexpected behavior may occur.  Please test your Public Pages thoroughly to make sure the behavior satisfies your requirements.
