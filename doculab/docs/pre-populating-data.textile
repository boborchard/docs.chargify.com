When linking to the Public Page, it is possible to have certain values pre-populated by passing parameters as GET requests.

The available parameters are:

* @first_name@: Fills the value for the customer's "First name" (Fills value for both Shipping/Contact info and Billing info, unless `billing_first_name` is provided)
* @last_name@: Fills the value for the customer's "Last name" (Fills value for both Shipping/Contact info and Billing info, unless `billing_first_name` is provided)
* @billing_first_name@: Fills the value for the Billing Address's "First Name" field (Overrides value provided by @first_name@, if any)
* @billing_last_name@: Fills the value for the Billing Address's "Last Name" field (Overrides value provided by @last_name@, if any)
* @email@: Fills the value for the customer's "Email address"
* @reference@: Sets a hidden field to supply a value for the customer's "reference" value (the unique identifier you use for the customer within your own application

*Pre-populating quantity-based components* can be set by passing in the component id (visible in your components list) and desired quantity.

Please note the order of the parameters matters to properly set the desired quantity for each component.

bc. ?components[][component_id]=16899&components[][allocated_quantity]=9

(For a description of how these attributes apply to the created customer and payment profile, please refer to the "Subscription Input Attributes" section of the [Subscriptions API documentation](http://support.chargify.com/faqs/api/api-subscriptions).)

For example, accessing a Public Signup Page URL with the following query string would generate the form pre-populated as shown below:

bc. ?first_name=John&last_name=Doe&email=john.doe@example.com&reference=1234
