When linking to the Public Page, it is possible to have certain values pre-populated by passing parameters as GET requests.

The available parameters are:

* @first_name@: Fills the value for the customer's "First Name" (Fills value for both Shipping/Contact info and Billing info, unless @billing_first_name@ is provided)
* @last_name@: Fills the value for the customer's "Last Name" (Fills value for both Shipping/Contact info and Billing info, unless @billing_first_name@ is provided)
