When creating and editing a Product, you will have the ability to set certain options that define the behavior for Subscriptions that are created to a Product (via a Subscription signup) and Subscriptions that are migrated to that Product (via an Upgrade or Downgrade, for example).

<!-- TODO: provide a screenshot of the Product Options -->

h3. API Handle

Used to specify a unique identifier for this product that you can use in API calls.  If you do not provide an explicit value here, a handle will be generated for you.  This can be considered a "friendly" identifier.  You could just as easily use the numeric ID to identify the resource.

h3. Credit Card Settings

For each product, you can select the display and validation settings for the presence of a credit card.

h4. Require credit card at signup?

This option displays whether or not the credit card must be present in order for any signup attempt to be valid. *This option affects both the Public Pages and API*. Hence, even if you are using the API for integration, if you want to be able to create a Subscription without an associated credit card, then you will need to uncheck this box.

NOTE: Creating Subscriptions without a credit card will only currently work if there is a zero amount due at signup.  Chargify will not create a Subscription with a positive balance, at the time of this writing.

h4. Billing and Shipping Address settings

These setting should be self-explanatory. Like the Credit Card Settings described above, the "Request" option controls the Public Page while the "Require" option controls all Subscription creations.

h3(#return-url-and-parameters). Return URL and Parameters

These fields apply specifically to the Self-Service Page which customers can use to update their payment information. They allow you to define a URL, optionally with dynamic parameters, to which the Self-Service Page will redirect after a successful credit card update. For the corresponding fields relating to Public Signup Pages, please see "Return URL and Parameters":/public-signup-page-settings#return-url. In addition to that, "Public Pages Intro":/public-pages-intro discusses the integration use-cases for these values concerning Public Signup Pages.
